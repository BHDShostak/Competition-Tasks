"""
In an even word, each letter occurs an even number of times.
Write a function solution that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns the minimum number of letters that
must be deleted to obtain an even word.
Examples:
1. Given S = "acbcbba", the function should return 1 (one letter b must be deleted).
2. Given S = "axxaxa", your function should return 2 (one letter a and one letter x must be deleted).
3. Given S = "aaaa", your function should return 0 (there is no need to delete any letters).
Write an e
cient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
string S consists only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z).
